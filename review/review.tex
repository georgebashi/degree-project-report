	you need to state what MIR is  
and then go on to tell the person what programs do it 
because atm all ur saying is "i will be using MIR and these people are already using it" 
range of applications of MIR 
you havent said what the applications are

Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a relatively young topic \citep{Fingerhut2004}, involving the study of 
Music Information Retrieval techniques are already in use in a number of commercial projects: Shazam! is a service where the user can play a short section of a song over a telephone, and it will identify and name the song from a massive database of popular tracks; MusicBrainz identifies digital music tracks against its massive database of metadata; sCrAmBlEd?HaCkZ! is a performance tool which matches the sounds from a live beatboxer to a database of audio/video fragments, playing matching sounds and video in sync with the beatboxer. While these systems provide a demonstration of the full range of applications of MIR, I will look specifically at playlist generation software, determining their weaknesses that my system will aim to improve upon.
\section{Concepts}
\section{Software}
\subsection{Ruffle}
Ruffle is a plugin for the Linux audio player Muine, providing simple playlist generation based on the user's listening habits and the genre specified in each track. When dealing with a large number of tracks and where a lot of data regarding frequently played tracks has been recorded, Ruffle works well to generate playlists based on a specifed start track or genre. Ruffle does fall down when dealing with music that is incorrectly labelled as it only infers similarity through tags on the audio such as artist, album or genre (a notoriously unreliable datasource), and from online services such as Last.fm, which do the same user habit recording but on a larger scale across all the users of the service.
\subsection{Last.fm}
Last.fm is an online service, whereby installing a plugin to the user's media player, the site tracks the listening habits of tens of thousands of users and aims for complete data capture, having actively maintained plugins for almost every media player application as well as some newer portable devices such as Apple's iPod. By tracking the play count, duration and time, the site provides suggestions to the user for new bands to hear, allows social networking by showing users with similar musical tastes, and provides weekly charts on ``what's hot''.
\subsection{The Filter}
The Filter is a plugin for Apple's iTunes, providing interpolative playlist generation similar to what I have implemented. It uses a statistical method similar to Ruffle's, providing `smart' generation of playlists either by specifying key tracks, or by exploring a specified genre.

\section{Review and Identification of Problem Areas}
\note{identification of key concepts and gaps in existing research}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How did previous attempts manage?
	\item Were they successful in achieving their objectives?
	\item What existing techniques can I borrow or adapt?
	\item Do I need to change my proposal?
\end{itemize}
Playlist generators based on symbolic, statistical analysis such as \software{Ruffle}, \software{The Filter} and \software{Last.fm} fall down on two areas: the fact that play counts for each track are their only source of data for statistical analysis, and the reliance on perfectly tagged audio for the recording of data. \software{The Filter} and \software{Last.fm} hope to improve on software such as \software{Ruffle} by correlating data between all its users, but still is unable to perform any playlist generation where the songs are completely untagged or `unseen' in its database. Additionally, these techniques rely on the user only listening to artists similar to each other, not accounting for users having wide tastes in music or even simply randomly listening to tracks from the whole library, as the order of tracks played is being recorded.

My system, however, performs its playlist generation based completely on the actual audio data itself through feature extraction, completely independent of the metadata of the song or any gathered statistics on the user's listening habits. This is analogous to the separation between Data Mining and statistics; while performing the same basic task, Data Mining techniques look at the implicit structures in the data such as high-dimensional trends, rather than the explicit counts and averages used in statistical methods. By having no reliance on the explicit structure (though I may, as an extension, use the play counts as an additional source of similarity data), my system is able to perform perfectly well on previously unseen songs or where little data has been collected about the user.
