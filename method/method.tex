\chapter{Method (3500)}
\section{Overview}
Talk about how this works (decode audio, extract features, measure similarity, interpolate) as a general overview
\subsection{Feature Extraction}
go into depth about feature extraction, talk about each extractor, how it works and what it models/looks for\\
talk about reasons not to implement a shit tonne and/or MFCC
\subsection{Similarity Measure}
problems of similarity measure - having to normalise the vectors\\
feature weights \& training
\subsection{Playlist Generation}
user interface
\section{Implementation}
issues with implementation
\begin{itemize}
	\item Benefits of two-pass, analyse/search method: faster to generate playlists, library rebuilt far less often than playlists generated
	\item simple arithmetic to generate playlist = fast enough (maybe?) to run on portable device
	\item only processes wav files - not important for demoing the ability of playlist generation
\end{itemize}
\section{Critique}
\begin{itemize}
	\item features of the selected paradigm and justification
	\item advantages and disadvantages of my implementation / approach
\end{itemize}
