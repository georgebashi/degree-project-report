\chapter{Method, Design, and Implementation (3500)}
\section{Overview}
Talk about how this works (decode audio, extract features, measure similarity, interpolate) as a general overview
\section{Theory \& Principles}
Explain the theory behind all this (psychoacoustics, DSP, etc.)
\subsection{Feature Extraction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item go into depth about feature extraction, talk about each extractor, how it works and what it models/looks for
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Signal Descriptors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain what this means, what these features show
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Zero Crossing Rate}
\subsubsection{First Order Autocorrelation}
\subsection{Spectral Descriptors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain what this means, what these features show
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Linear Regression}
\subsubsection{Centroid}
\subsubsection{Intensity}
\subsubsection{Smoothness}
\subsubsection{Spread}
\subsubsection{Dissymmetry}
\subsection{Commentry(?)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item talk about reasons not to implement a shit tonne
	\item other possible extractors - MFCC, others used in Marsyas
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Similarity Measure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item problems of similarity measure
	\begin{itemize}
		\item having to normalise the vectors
		\item choices of algorithm for how to compare tracks - how does order of comparison affect results in similarity measure?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 3sec blocks give bias to songs with beat aligned to block boundary (combatted by overall song features) - compare blocks in neighbouring groups to beat this
			\item structure (verse/chorus, intro, delay at start) will strongly affect a simple ordered comparison
			\item sorted \& total comparisons give `complete' comparison of track, though take O(n!) time to complete
			\item ``as of such I have implemented four techniques and will see which is best'' (har har)
		\end{itemize}
		\item NaN problems
	\end{itemize}
	\item feature weights - why have them, why train them
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Playlist Generation}
user interface
\subsection{Weight Optimisation}
why have weights for the features, why train them
\begin{itemize}
	\item explain how the weight training works - listener testing app which plays three clips, the user selects which two are most similar
	\item why this helps us
	\item what we can use the results for
	\item other ways of collecting similar data
	\begin{itemize}
		\item tracks off the same album most likely similar - especially in the case of a compilation album
		\item last.fm and other services ``similar songs'' based on statistics can be used as a guide to the training on which songs are simliar
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	\item system can discover important features for itself
	\item as it is not completely understood how we percieve sound, feature extractors only work as a basic model, therefore it is best to use lots of these models and let empirical evidence from testing `teach' the system the best models to use
	\item weights will help the system return results similar to the results given by the user - the perfect system would take the data learned from the user in the testing app and return identical results - we can test how similar the results of our system is to the user's output for a good measure of the efficacy of the system
\end{itemize}
\section{Implementation}
issues with implementation
\begin{itemize}
	\item Benefits of two-pass, analyse/search method: faster to generate playlists, library rebuilt far less often than playlists generated
	\item simple arithmetic to generate playlist = fast enough (maybe?) to run on portable device
	\begin{itemize}
		\item it is possible to precalcuate all distances between songs - size/speed tradeoff - take up more space on portable device but trivial to generate playlists on-the-go
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Critique (of Design)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item features of the selected paradigm and justification
	\item advantages and disadvantages of my implementation / approach
	\item draw up a table in notes, easier to relate things
\end{itemize}
