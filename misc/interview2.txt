more upbeat
less harmonic
very similar genre though the vocals are different
similar instrumentation - very electronic

completely different genre
both quite repetitive

similar tempo/vocals
changes mood throughout the track but colours stays pretty similar throughout
track similar is slightly more similar than 1

not similar however it has the same structure
similar rhythm although it is more upbeat
first track that would stick out in a playlist

very similar in mood

Sneaker pimps to killswitch - very dissimilar songs
transition into and away from saves the day works very well
good playlist overall

------------------------------
#1 at first appeared to be the computer as the songs did sound similar in mood and tempo, however after listening closely to playlist 3 it became apparent that that was the computer generated one as there was a progression of music whereas number 1 just has a bunch of songs stuck togehter to form a list
#2 is George and this is shown by the non progressive change in songs as the songs change in blocks. the first three songs of the play list are very similar to each other, as are the third and fourth, but tehy arent similar to each other. also george likes these bands and i am his girlfriend and can read him lke a book :)
#3 is computer as the first three songs have very similar introductions and tempo, and the last 3 too!
4 and 5 have the same layed back mood





sorry i couldnt think of any big words im sure you#ll find them for me
