\section{Specifications and Requirement Analysis}
The system was designed around a set of user and research requirements for a system which would meet the rationale of easing the selection of music.
\section{System Objectives}
\subsection{User Requirements}
The base-line requirements for the needs of an end-user are:
\objective{Analysing the user's media library in a reasonable time-frame}
The processing of each song must run as quickly as possible (as a large number of songs will be processed), therefore \software{C++} is used as the development language. Audio and features are stored together, to eliminate the need to re-calculate features.
\objective{Avoiding storing too much data}
\label{text:spec:requirement:data}
If a large amount of data for each song is stored it affects the scalability of the application, due to the requisite disk space.
\objective{Providing a simpler method of playlist generation than selecting individual tracks}
If playlists are created on a macro level, the user is simply able to specify the overall mood and genre of the playlist.
\objective{Basing playlist generation solely on analysis of audio data}
Using a sub-symbolic similarity metric, there is no reliance on pre-existing metadata for each song in the user's media library.
\subsection{Research Requirements}
\objective{Providing a method to verify and view results at each step of the processing}
Tracking data flow through each step of the system can help to show any sub-optimal or incorrect areas. A tool to view any binary files such as the output of the feature extractor verifies correct operation. Also, where necessary, program options reveal more detailed output for testing and debugging.
\objective{Providing a simple method to analyse music and create playlists in batch for testing}
\label{text:spec:objective:cli}
A command-line interface is implemented, outputting in a standard playlist format allowing playlists to be directly loaded into a media player. Batch scripts to be created which can automate testing and eases debugging of the system.
