\section{Introduction}
While creating playlists allows the user to listen to a variety of music, it is a lengthy process to select a number of songs which will fit the \emph{context of use}, such as working, exercising or cleaning. The system described provides \emph{playlist generation}, using a metric which works solely on audio data by using statistical functions to estimate perceptual similarity between tracks. Songs similar to the key tracks are used to fill the playlist, based on a set of rules of `good' playlist generation. In this way, novel and interesting playlists are created, either equivalent to or better than a user-generated playlist.
